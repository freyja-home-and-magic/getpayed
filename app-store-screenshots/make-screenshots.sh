# Sizes, per App Store Connect's current spec:

#   iphone-6.9   1320x2868   the only size an iPhone app is REQUIRED to
#                            supply. App Store Connect scales it down for
#                            every smaller iPhone automatically.
#   iphone-6.5   1284x2778   optional; kept because the folder already
#                            existed and some listings still show it.
#   ipad-13      2064x2752   only relevant if the app ships for iPad.
#                            GetPayed sets TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY "1"
#                            (iPhone only) in build-ios.cjs, so App Store
#                            Connect won't even offer an iPad slot. Generated
#                            anyway so the set is ready if that changes.
#
# No alpha channel: App Store Connect rejects screenshots with transparency,
# the same rule that applies to the 1024 marketing icon.

# (iPhone 16 Pro): the glyphs run x 32..232, y 102..140, and TF_* below adds a
# few pixels of margin. It used to be 0,96..268,146, which was guesswork and
# overshot the text by about 30px on each side.
#
# It sits on flat #1a1a1a with nothing behind it, so painting over it is
# pixel-exact rather than a visible patch. The originals are untouched, so
# rerunning without SKIP_TF_MASK=1 restores whatever you prefer.
#
# This only removes OS chrome. It doesn't alter anything the app drew, which
# would misrepresent the product -- and the two guards below refuse to run
# when that promise can't be kept, rather than leaving you to eyeball it.

#
# With no freetype, every text operator silently falls through to Ghostscript
# and the build dies with `sh: gs: command not found`. Installing ghostscript
# would NOT fix it properly — it only gets you the PostScript base 35 fonts,
# not SF Pro. CoreText draws the same system font the app draws, so the
